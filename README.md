# b-suitors

This is my implementation of the concurrent b-suitors algorithm described in [*Efficient approximation algorithms for weighted b-Matching* (Khan, Arif, et al, 2016)](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/apothen/Papers/bMatching-SISC-2016.pdf).

This was my project for Concurrent Programming course.
